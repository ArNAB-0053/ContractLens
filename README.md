# Business Contract Validation and Comparison Application - **ContractLens**  

**ContractLens** is a project developed to simplify the management of legal contracts. It provides features like text extraction, contract comparison, and validation to assist businesses in analyzing and ensuring the integrity of their contracts. This tool is designed to be practical, functional, and user-friendly.

## üåü Features Overview  

### üìù **Text Extraction**  
- Extract clean, formatted text from uploaded business contract files.  
- Ensure accurate parsing with support for complex legal text structures.  

### üìÑ **Contract Comparison**  
- Highlight differences and similarities between two contracts side-by-side.  
- Detect clauses and validate key sections for potential conflicts or mismatches.  

### ‚úÖ **Business Contract Validation**  
- Analyze contracts to ensure they comply with pre-defined standards and legal guidelines.  
- Flag missing clauses, risky language, or deviations from best practices.  
- **Similarity Checking**: Calculate the similarity between sections of two contracts.  
- **Highlighting Differences**: Identify and visually highlight mismatched or differing clauses.  
- **Clause Detection and Matching**:  
  - Detect and show **specific clauses** for better evaluation.  
  - Powered by a trained model utilizing the [Legal Clause Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bahushruth/legalclausedataset) to ensure accurate and context-aware clause extraction.

## üîÑ Workflow  

1. **PDF Upload**: Upload business contract files in PDF format.  
2. **Text Extraction**: Extract text from the PDF for analysis.  
3. **Text Preprocessing**:  
   - Perform text cleaning, including lemmatization and stopword removal.  
   - Convert text into vectorized format using pre-trained models.  
   - Extract paragraphs for detailed comparison.  
4. **Paragraph Matching**: Map corresponding paragraphs for side-by-side evaluation.  
5. **Similarity Calculation**: Compare mapped paragraphs for textual similarity.  
6. **Difference Highlighting**: Visually indicate differences in structure, content, or language.![workfllow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e8ee7b4-d6ea-4ebc-bc42-679bf1d3e2d8)

7. **Clause Prediction**: Identify and predict **specific clauses** in contracts using a trained model.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- If package installation fails, check individual package documentation
- Ensure all prerequisites are properly installed
- Keep dependencies updated to latest stable versions

## üìù Notes

1. **Local Usage**  
   - The application is not hosted and relies on **local storage** (your PC/Laptop, not browser-based) for certain tasks.  
   - Please **carefully read and understand the code** before using or modifying it to ensure compatibility with your environment.  

2. **Planned Enhancements**  
   Some functionalities are not fully implemented yet, but they **may be added in the future** as the project evolves. Stay tuned! üöÄ 

## üë• Team

This project was collaboratively developed as part of the **IntelUnnati Training Program**. It was a **team effort**, and I acknowledge the significant contributions of my team members. While I made several modifications to the backend logic and frontend interface, the core implementation is a shared achievement. üë´ü§ù  

## üìù Development Notes

- Backend uses Flask for API endpoints
- Frontend built with Next.js
- SpaCy model required for text processing
- Both servers must run simultaneously for full functionality
